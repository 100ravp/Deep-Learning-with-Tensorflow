# Deep-Learning-with-Tensorflow

## Course Deatils

In this course I'm going to teach different machine learning algorithms and there implementation in TensorFlow
Next thing you are going to learn from this lecture series is how to use tensorflow 
so once we learn any lagorithm we will try to do a project using that algorithm 
and for that we will be using the google colab 
so in a way you will learn how to use google colab
and there wont be any video explaining how to use google colab 
because that we will learn during the projects as well
