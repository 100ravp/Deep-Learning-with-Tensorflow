# Deep-Learning-with-Tensorflow

## Course Details

In this course I'm going to teach different machine learning algorithms and there implementation in TensorFlow.

### So what you will learn from this course

- First thing you will learn is different deep learning algorithms like artificial neural network, convolutional nueral network and etc etc
 
- Next thing you are going to learn from this lecture series is how to use tensorflow so once we learn any algorithm we will try to do a project using that algorithm 
  and for that we will be using the google colab so in a way you will learn how to use google colab, and there wont be any video explaining how to use google colab 
  because that we will learn during the projects.
